DesignLab IDE - A modified version of the Arduino IDE for the Papilio FPGA board. 
previously name ZAP IDE

Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free.

For more information, see the website at: http://www.arduino.cc/
or the forums at: http://arduino.cc/forum/

INSTALLATION
Detailed instructions are in reference/Guide_Windows.html and

CREDITS
Arduino is an open source project, supported by many.

The Arduino team is composed of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe,
Gianluca Martino, Daniela Antonietti, and David A. Mellis.

Arduino uses the GNU avr-gcc toolchain, avrdude, avr-libc, and code from
Processing and Wiring.

*Everything works in Linux now.
*There is a option in the preferences window to set location of adobe reader and ISE.
*AVR8 works under Linux now.
*Logic Analyzer client is in a shared location now.
*Papilio Loader is included in a shared location.

*New project option added to the Papilio menu.

ZAP 2.2.0 - 2014.1.30
[ide]
*Updates to make linux build work
*Copy entire contents of a sketch directory when doing a SaveAs

[Papilio Schematic Libary - Version 1.6]

-JTAG Logic Analyzer Example
-Analog Wing Example
-Updated RetroCade Synth example with support for Analog readout

ZAP 2.1	- 2014.1.16
[ide]
* Allow clickable URLs in the sketch for bit files, ISE projects, and schematics.
* Add Papilio Menu
* Add Papilio Schematic Library 1.5

[zpuino]
* Fix missing Papilio Pro ID from bootloader/board type.
* Add SPI library
* Add SPIADC library
* Add SevenSegment Hardware library
* Update all libraries to allow selecting what wishbone slot to use.

ZAP 2.0.7 BETA - 2013.11.26

[zpuino]
* Updated audio libraries to allow specifying the wishbone slot. This is for Papilio Schematic Library.
* Removed ZPU 2.0, it was confusing people.

ZAP 2.0.6 BETA - 2013.10.16

[zpuino]

[zpuino]
* Added Hyperion variants for LogicStart and Arcade MegaWing board types
* Added bootloader functionality that associates bit files with each board type
* Libraries moved to ZPUino hardware type
* Experimental ZPUino 2.0 plugin added
